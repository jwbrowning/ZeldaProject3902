Known Issues and Roadmap

Code Analysis

Sprint Reflection
We did a better job at getting work done this sprint but with break and finals approaching people have limited availability making it harder to meet up and coordinate then other sprints. Overall we were able to achieve most of what we wanted and are proud of how the game has progressed and turned out.
Lights: 3 hours -> 4 hours
Reverse Time: 2 hours -> 3 hours
Cheat Codes: 2 hours -> 4 hours
Updated AI: 3 hours -> 4 hours
Dodongo Implementation: 2 hours -> 3 hours
Bug Fixes: 1 hours â€“> 2 hours
In conclusion I feel like we did a good job with this sprint a lot of work was done in advance before the due date and not that much was saved for the last minute. 
Most things took about as long as we expected although we may have undersold it a bit. 
Overall, it was a successful sprint and we were able to achieve most of what we wanted.
better job overall organizing and getting work done this sprint.
