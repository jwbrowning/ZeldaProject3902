Known Issues and Roadmap

Enemy pathing works but needs improvement. Currently enemies will try to track link however especially with the bats they will overlap and then basically be one bat following around link.
Particles like the enemy spawn effect, death effect, and sword beam particles need to be added.

Additional Features

In addition to the required features for the sprint, we also added a new feature of our own. We made the boomerang able to carry items along with it as it is thrown. So if you throw your 
boomerang at an item on the ground, such as a map, it will carry the map back to you.For testing purposes, we also added controls to enable/disable 
showing of colliders by pressing c and v.

Code Analysis

Sprint Reflection
As a team we did a better job being more on top of the work this sprint. However, we are still waiting until the last few days to get a lot of the work
done, but it is understandable with everyone having busy schedules. On the contrary we did a better job of communicating during the sprint and giving 
updates on what work we had done in comparison to sprint 3. Here are the time estimated and time worked.
Heads Up Display   5hrs - 6hrs
Resetting level   2hrs - 2hrs
Doors   2hrs - 3hrs 
Scrolling Transition    3hrs - 3hrs
Game State Transitions    8hr - 9hrs 
Sounds    3hrs - 4hrs
Enenmy Pathing    2hrs - 3hrs
Game Walls    1hrs - 2 hrs
In conclusion I feel like we did a better job overall organizing and getting work done this sprint.

We had these warnings when we tried doing analysis:
