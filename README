README Code Description
Our code currently hits all sprint 2 specifications. The arrow and and  "wasd" keys control link and change his direction while the "z" and "n" key cause him to swing his sword. Each number key will cause link to use a specific item, while as the "e" key will damage link. Blocks and obstacles appear fixed on screen and can be switched with the "t" and "y" keys. Items are controlled by the "u" and "i" keys in order to swap between next and previous items. Items are also animated. Enemies also appear on screen and are animated. Enemies can be swapped next to previous using the "o" and "p" keys. Finally, "q" is used to quit, and "r" will reset the screen to the initial loaded version of the game. Are code is organized with interfaces and then underlying classes which implement said interfaces. We have created interfaces for commands, controllers, game objects, and sprites. Beneath those we have separate classes for individual link, items, obstacles, enemies, and keyboard controls. The Link.cs class is under the PlayerStuff folder and controls all of links movements and animation in the future we may need to make link smaller and edit the sprite sheet cutoffs to make the animation look cleaner. All enemy classes are in the EnemySpriteClasses folder and handle each individualâ€™s animation and location data. The same is true for obstacles and items which fall under the Environment and Items folders respectfully. All keyboard controls are housed under the CommandStuff folder and call methods to execute each needed function. These folder names are most temporary and will be changed at a later time to make things clearer.

Code Analysis

Sprint Reflection
I think the team preformed well this sprint, however there is definite room for improvement. We did a good job of meeting and organizing our self at the start of the sprint by creating a discord server to communicate, a GitHub repository for our code, as well and a Trello board to manage tasks and decide who would be working on what. After that everyone mostly worked on their own to complete their tasks and add it to the GitHub. I think we could have done a better job of communicating when we each got our tasks done in order to start combining them sooner. We waited until the last weekend to start combining all of our code which was fine, but we definitely could have done so sooner which would have been relived a little bit of stress and have been a better use of the 3 weeks allotted for sprint 2. We noticed we are a lot more productive when all 5 members of the group can meet all at one time. So, for future sprints we are going to make a defined schedule for meeting and working instead of just seeing when everyone is free day of.
