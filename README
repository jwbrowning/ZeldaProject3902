README Code Description
Our code currently hits all Sprint 3 specifications building off of our sprint 2 foundation. We have implemented collision handling code for link, enemies, environment, and items. Where link and enemies are unable to walk through walls or environmental obstacles. Items such as the boomerang can not go through walls but are able to fly over some environmental obstacles. Additionally, we have all of our room data stored in xml files and are able to cycle through rooms by clicking the left and right mouse buttons. Each room is modeled after the first dungeon and is equipped with enemies and obstacles. 

Known Issues and Roadmap

Enemy pathing works but needs improvement. Currently enemies will try to track link however especially with the bats they will overlap and then basically be one bat following around link.
Particles like the enemy spawn effect, death effect, and sword beam particles need to be added.

Code Analysis

Sprint Reflection
As a team we did a better job being more on top of the work this sprint. However, we are still waiting until the last few days to get a lot of the work done, but it is understandable with everyone having busy schedules. On the contrary we did a better job of communicating during the sprint and giving updates on what work we had done in comparison to sprint 2. At the beginning of the sprint we thought doing collision code would take us about 10 hours in total to get working and smoothed out which was close to what actually ended up happening. In total the collision code took about 10-15 hours. On the other hand, we thought creating rooms would only take about 5-7 hours, but we ran into some issues and it ended up taking much longer, closer to 10-15 in order to get transitions and loading all pieces in smoothly. In conclusion I feel like we did a better job overall organizing and getting work done this sprint even though we have definite room to continue to get better in the next few coming sprints.


We had these warnings when we tried doing analysis:
