Known Issues and Roadmap

We decided not to implement moveable blocks, but might in the future.
Bug: Keys still spawn in the same room after you collect it then leave and return. We noticed this pretty late and will fix it before the next sprint. The same thing applies to enemies that drop a key, and keys that spawn when all enemies are killed
Sometimes the game over audio will play to completion, even after you reset the game.
If you change rooms with the mouse and end up inside a block, Link vanishes and you'll need to reset the game with R.

Code Analysis

Sprint Reflection
As a team we did a better job being more on top of the work this sprint. However, we are still waiting until the last few days to get a lot of the work
done, but it is understandable with everyone having busy schedules. On the contrary we did a better job of communicating during the sprint and giving 
updates on what work we had done in comparison to sprint 3. Here are the time estimated vs. time worked.
Heads Up Display   5hrs - 5hrs
Resetting level   2hrs - 2hrs
Doors   2hrs - 6hrs 
Scrolling Transition    3hrs - 3hrs
Game State Transitions    8hr - 4hrs 
Sounds    3hrs - 4hrs
Enemy Pathing    2hrs - 4hrs
Game Walls    1hrs - 3 hrs
In conclusion I feel like we did a better job overall organizing and getting work done this sprint.
Most things for this sprint took about as long as we expected. 
The Game State Transitionts were a lot simpler than we had first thought, originally we wanted two people to work on them but we ended up just having one person, and it took half the time expected.
The Doors and Walls turned out to be more complicated than we thought, we hadn't considered all the different functionalities for doors like bombing, unlocking, and opening closed doors.
Overall it felt like we were more prepared for work this sprint, however we still had quite a bit to do the weekend before the due date.
