Specific comments on code quality
	- Strong/high cohesion, loose coupling

A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change
	⁃	I don’t see any change currently that couldn’t be implemented with the given code.
		- could remove some of the commmented out part of the code extra storage waste
	⁃	Over all the code is of good quality, it does what it needs to do
	- Could try a diffrent approach to make the methodology a little bit simpler other than that great job
