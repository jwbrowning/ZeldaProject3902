Overall pretty easy to read and understand. 
There are a couple lines with an unneccessary use of the ternary operator, and the if/else structure is rather large, but overall it is not difficult to read. 
Variable names make sense and are understandable.
The class implements the IController interface, which contains the RegisterCommand method, but the code does not actually make use of the method.
