Comments: I didn't notice any major readability errors. A minor change
	I would make is to label which directionCode corresponds to each 
	direction (e.g. a comment labeling that directionCode 1 means the 
	boomerang was thrown to the right). The variable name "drawBoomerang"
	seems a little unclear. It might be better if it was called something
	like "boomerangExpired" and had the trues/falses reversed. That may
	just be personal preference, though.
