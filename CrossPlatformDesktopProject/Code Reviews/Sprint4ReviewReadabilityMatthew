Comments: 

This is a lightweight classfile for a pretty specific job and it does it nicely while being clean. Code is concise and easy to read. Adequate commenting where needed and is largely self-explanatory and easy to understand. Good separation of code using methods. 

public LootManagement(){} empty, seems like unnecessary code. Just a remark though does not hamper readability.
