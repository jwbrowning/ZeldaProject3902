Specific comments on what is readable and what is not

Code is mostly readable due to strong/high cohesion 
Almost all the variables are named in a proper format.
	-2-3 of the C# conventions not being followed on the file other that than great work not that big a deal

Naming conventions on the images are good as well.
Overall code readability is of good quality.
