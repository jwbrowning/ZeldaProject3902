Specific comments on what is readable and what is not

Code is mostly readable due to strong/high cohesion 
Almost all the variables are named in a proper format.
	-i dont think that movementframe is being used double check to see if you should remove it

Naming conventions on the images are proper as well.
Overall code readability is of good quality.
