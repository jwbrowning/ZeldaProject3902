Specific comments on code quality:
I think the quality of this code is good collisions in itself are complicated but the code is not too complicated where it cant be easily followed.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
I would add more comments to explain a few lines more indepth I would also clean up a few variable names to make it more clear aka "Point d" may not even be
used anywhere in the code but is initalized without any context to what it is doing. Making these changes would should not have any changes to the current 
logic behind the implimentation and should be easily supported.
