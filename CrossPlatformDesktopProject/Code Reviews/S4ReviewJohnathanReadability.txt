Comments: Some lines like 59 feature a lot of math that should probably be broken into multiple lines and multiple variables
	I might add some comments to explain what certain items like the map and compass do,
	if you're not familiar with the game. Some iterators like 103-110 could use more
	descriptive variable names.
