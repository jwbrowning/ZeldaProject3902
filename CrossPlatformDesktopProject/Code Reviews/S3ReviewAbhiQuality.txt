Specific Comments: I have no notable issues with this code. I might change 
	the "if" statements in update() to "if else" just for readability,
	but it's perfectly functional as is. A small change,
	though it's more a change to all sprites, would be to remove the 
	spritebatch.Begin() and spritebatch.End() methods from the Draw() method
	of this class and add them to the Draw() method in Game1, but that's 
	not terribly relevant. 

Hypothetical Change: Since each fireball is counted as an enemy, this 
	could impact code that uses the enemies list. For example, if we had
	an item that restored health as enemies were slain (removed from
	the list), you could theoretically just wait in the Aquamentus room
	for it to shoot fireballs, and gain infinite life. This could be easily 
	solved by having the player's items (like the sword and bow) track
	their kills, rather than relying on when enemies were removed from
	the gamespace.
