Comments: Some methods are really long, like DrawVisibleRegion() at around 
	74 lines. It may be better to split it up into a couple of methods, 
	just for readability. It looks like most methods only take 1 or 2 arguments,
	which is good. 
Hypothetical change: Currently, the only two things that emit light are Link
	and the sword beam. If we wanted more light emitters like torches or 
	special items, they'd have to be hard coded in to the lighting manager.
	It might be better to edit items and environmental objects to have some
	kind of "emitsLight" boolean field, or a "lightingRadius" float field, where 
	0 represents a non-emitting object. Then the manager could use this data for
	its calculations instead of relying on hardcoded information.
