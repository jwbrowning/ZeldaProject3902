Specific comments on code quality:
I like the code quality it is mostly if chains but I do not think there is a better way to do it without being very complex.
A hypothetical change to make to the game related to file being reviewed and how the current implementation could or could not easily support that change:
One thing i might change one adding more comments to increase readability in addition to making some other methods in order t keep some less crowded.
