Specific comments on what is readable and what is not:
THe code is overall very readable even though collision code is oftentimes complicated there are some goood comments explaining if 
statements and what is happening inside them. I would maybe just add some more exampling what each group of lines is doing. Also the variable names make 
it pretty eay to understand waht each varibale is trying to do.
