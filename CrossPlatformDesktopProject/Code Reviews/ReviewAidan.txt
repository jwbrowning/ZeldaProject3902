Author of the code review: Abhi Malisetty

Time Taken: 20 minutes
Sprint number: 2
Name of the .cs file being reviewed: ControllerKeyboard.cs
Author of the .cs file being reviewed: Aidan Haskett

Code Quality:
- Good design and structure. Modular
- If we wanted to add another type of object to cycle through (like npcs, blocks etc.) it would be easy to add the functionality with the current structure. Given that the code for those functions are implemented in a seperate class.
- Perhaps the code for the stop moving logic can be in another class but it may be necessary for it to be in this class

Code Readability:
- Descriptive class & variable names
- Overall lightweight and easy to follow code
- Some if loops in the Update() method have long conditions but it is still readable
