Comments: While most of the methods are understandable, I think some comments
	could help the reader to understand some things, e.g. the purposes of Ray
	vs RaycastPoint. Some method names could be changed, such as changing
	VisibleRegion() to GetVisibleRegion(), or Intersection() to FindIntersection().
	Maybe some minor organizational changes as well, so that it's easier to see 
	where certain methods are used.
