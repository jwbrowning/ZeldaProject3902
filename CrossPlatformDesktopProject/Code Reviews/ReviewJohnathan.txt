Maintainability:
	Comments on quality: Everything seems to be written well. The most notable thing I see is a triple-nested if, but it's not really a big deal at all.
	Hypothetical change: As is, the current implementation has all animations using the same frame interval, which means that brief/quick animations 
		like swinging the sword or taking damage appear as if in slow motion. We could fix this by making two separate frame intervals for walking and 
		for attacking, or in a "dirtier" method we could reduce the frame interval and then edit the spritesheet so that Link "animates" through several 
		identical frames before changing to a new one.

Readability:
	Time to complete the review: 15 minutes
	Specific comments: The code is pretty readable for the most part, though a couple lines seem a little long or hard to parse (such as the rectangle 
		creation on line 76). Other than that, maybe just a couple of minor things like changing a variable name or two (like changing "width" to "spriteWidth"
		in the Draw method) or a comment to explain what some variables mean. All in all, pretty good!
