Readability
-descriptive variable names
-easy to understand formatting
-good naming conventions

Maintainability
-using separate variables for x and y positions instead of vector2
-large if statement structure in update function, could maybe benefit from using a state structure
-handling of fireballs and sprites all handled within same class, could benefit from separating them into different classes like a Fireball.cs and an EnemySprite.cs and managing their creation in the main Aquamentus class
