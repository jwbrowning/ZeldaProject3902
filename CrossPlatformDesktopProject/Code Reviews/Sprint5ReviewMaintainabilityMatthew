Comments: 

No issues in the code. Having separation for LoadGame and SaveGame is a good idea. This helps in terms of having a foundation for expanding upon the save system since it is somewhat barebones at the moment.

Hypothetical Change: 

Transforming the save system into a more complex and robust savestate system. Where multiple instances and saves of the game can be stored and loaded even after the game is closed and reopened. I think this code has provided the foundation that can be built upon to create a nice savestate system. The lowest levels of such a system has already been created (each save), it would just be the higher level stuff like managing multiple saves that would need to be handled now.
